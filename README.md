# VendingMachineKata

This is a code exercise found here: <a href="https://github.com/guyroyse/vending-machine-kata">Vending Machine Kata</a>
<br/><br/>
I also put together a testing harness that is built on top of the VendingMachine code.  It is an executable jar file that runs a GUI to enable exploratory testing of the VendingMachineCode:
