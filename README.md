# VendingMachineKata

This is a code exercise found here: <a href="https://github.com/guyroyse/vending-machine-kata">Vending Machine Kata</a>
<br/><br/>
As well as the code for the exercise, I put together a testing harness that is built on top of the VendingMachine code.  It is an executable jar file that runs a GUI to enable exploratory testing of the VendingMachineCode: 
<a href="https://github.com/chris-atkins/VendingMachineKata/raw/master/RunnableTestUI_ForTheVendingMachine.jar">Download Runnable Test UI</a>
<br/><br/>
The code for the test UI is super rough right now so I have not pushed it.  (you never know who could be looking at this stuff :).  Anyways, if anyone is interested in seeing it, let me know and I'll tidy it up some and push it.
